    <h1>Iterators, Co-routines and other stack torture</h1>
    <h2>Perl, Python, and Ruby side-by-side</h2>

    <p>
    An iterator is a programming construct that solves the problem of
    trying to return a series of values to a block of client code.
    Although Perl, Python, and Ruiby all allow a function to return a
    list, an iterator is still more powerful in that it can produce
    the values one at a time.  This allows the client code to start
    working as soon as the first value is produced.  It also allows
    the client code to decide how many values it wants while it is
    running, instead of passing in the desired list length that the
    beginning.
